## Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 4 (L4)

Launched in January 2015, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission describes the near polar, sun synchronous orbiting observatory that has been providing estimates of soil moisture and the freeze/thaw state of the land surface (Description Mission SMAP; Global Modeling and Assimilation Office Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Mission Level 4 Surface and Root Zone Soil Moisture (L4_SM) Product Specification Document; Reichle et al.). 

Brightness temperatures are measured at 1.41 GHz while backscatter is measured at 1.26 GHz and 1.29 GHz (Reichle et al.). The observatory will travel in 117 repeatable cycles with ascending and descending orbits taking place. 6:00 and 18:00 local time, respectively (Reichle et al.). 

The Level 4 data describes the data derived from the assimilation of resampled and corrected raw observations of surface microwave emissions and radar backscatter into a version of the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 (GEOS-5) land data assimilation system (LDAS) (Data Products Data SMAP; Global Modeling and Assimilation Office Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Mission Level 4 Surface and Root Zone Soil Moisture (L4_SM) Product Specification Document; Reichle et al.). SMAP data products are output in HDF5 format files.

More information about the SMAP mission can be found at [NASA.gov]( https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov). Additionally, while data for this project was retrieved from `/shared/land/SMAP/latest_L4/daily` on the remote server for the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies at George Mason University, it is made publicly available through two NASA designated data centers: the [Alaska Satellite Facility(ASF)](https://asf.alaska.edu/data-sets/sar-data-sets/soil-moisture-active-passive-smap-mission/) and  the [National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)](https://nsidc.org/data/smap)(Data Products | Data – SMAP).
